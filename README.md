## About this fork
This is a fork of the (now archived) Jellyfin Qt desktop client, kept alive for couch/controller use. Changes over upstream:
- **SDL gamepad focus-gating** — controller input only registers while the window has focus (`src/input/InputComponent.cpp`)
- **Keyboard remap fix** (`resources/inputmaps/keyboard.json`)
- **CI/CMake build fixes** so the project builds again

Everything below is the original upstream README.

# Jellyfin Desktop
> [!WARNING]
> **Deprecated:** Development of this Qt-based desktop client has stopped in favor of a completely rewritten client built on SDL and CEF. The new client can be found at [jellyfin/jellyfin-desktop](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-desktop).

Jellyfin desktop client built with Qt WebEngine and [libmpv](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv). Supports audio passthrough, hardware decoding, and playback of more formats without transcoding.
